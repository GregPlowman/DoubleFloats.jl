# DoubleFloats



## Introduction

When you are `using DoubleFloats`, you have three more floating point types:
- `Double64` is a magnitude ordered, nonoverlapping pair of Float64s
- `Double32` is a magnitude ordered, nonoverlapping pair of Float32s
- `Double16` is a magnitude ordered, nonoverlapping pair of Float16s

Many arithmetic operations and elementary functions are available with each type.

- flipsign, copysign, signbit, sign, abs
- ==, !=, <, <=, >=, >, isless, isequal
- +, -, *, /, ^, floor, ceil, trunc, round (to integer)
- square, cube, sqrt, cbrt
- hypot, normalize
- exp, expm1, log, log1p
- sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot
- asin, acos, atan, acsc, asec, acot
- sinh, cosh, tanh, csch, sech, coth
- asinh, acosh, atanh, acsch, asech, acoth
